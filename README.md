# ESP32
ESP32 ESP-Now and Web Server.
The project implements ESP-Now in a one to many configuration.  An ESP32 Controller web server user interface allows controlling GPIOs of receiver ESP32s. In the example, the control is of the on-board LED of multiple receiver boards.
Both an ESP-Now default transmission security and encrypted transmission security examples are provided.
The code was created using Arduino IDE with a board selection of DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1 and the actual boards being NodeMCU EPS32S V1.1.
